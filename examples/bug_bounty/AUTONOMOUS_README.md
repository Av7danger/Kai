## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Run the setup script
python setup_bug_bounty.py

# Or install manually
pip install cai-framework
```

### 2. Configure API Keys
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Add your Gemini API key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 3. Create Scope Configuration
```bash
# Generate scope template
python autonomous_controller.py --create-template

# Edit the generated file with your bug bounty program details
# Example: bug_bounty_scope.yaml
```

### 4. Run Autonomous Hunt
```bash
# Start fully autonomous hunt
python autonomous_controller.py --config bug_bounty_scope.yaml
```

## üìã Scope Configuration

Create a detailed scope configuration file (`bug_bounty_scope.yaml`):

```yaml
# Bug Bounty Program Scope Configuration

targets:
  - "example.com"
  - "api.example.com"
  - "staging.example.com"

in_scope:
  - "*.example.com"
  - "example.com"
  - "api.example.com"
  - "mobile.example.com"

out_of_scope:
  - "mail.example.com"
  - "internal.example.com"
  - "*.internal.example.com"
  - "admin.example.com"

allowed_methods:
  - "GET"
  - "POST"
  - "PUT"
  - "DELETE"
  - "PATCH"
  - "OPTIONS"

forbidden_paths:
  - "/admin/delete"
  - "/admin/reset"
  - "/admin/users/delete"
  - "/system/shutdown"

# Testing Configuration
rate_limit: 10              # Requests per second
max_depth: 3               # Maximum crawling depth
timeout: 7200              # Session timeout (2 hours)
business_hours_only: false # Respect business hours
safe_mode: true           # Extra safety checks

# Advanced Options
stealth_mode: true        # Use stealth techniques
user_agent_rotation: true # Rotate user agents
proxy_rotation: false    # Use proxy rotation
```

## üß† Autonomous Workflow

The system executes a comprehensive 5-phase autonomous workflow:

### **Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering**
- OSINT collection and target validation
- Technology stack identification
- Attack surface mapping
- Business context analysis
- Scope validation and expansion

### **Phase 2: Adaptive Reconnaissance**
- Multi-technique subdomain enumeration
- Intelligent port scanning
- API endpoint discovery
- Content discovery with smart wordlists
- Certificate and historical data analysis

### **Phase 3: Smart Vulnerability Discovery**
- Technology-specific vulnerability testing
- Business logic flaw analysis
- Authentication bypass testing
- Input validation testing (XXS, SQLi, etc.)
- Custom payload generation

### **Phase 4: Intelligent Exploitation**
- Proof-of-concept enhancement
- Impact demonstration
- Business risk calculation
- Remediation guidance generation
- False positive validation

### **Phase 5: Automated Reporting**
- Structured vulnerability reports
- Executive summaries
- Technical documentation
- Next steps generation
- Metrics compilation
