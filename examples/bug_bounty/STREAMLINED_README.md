# 🎯 Streamlined Autonomous Bug Hunter - Complete Workflow

## 📋 **Exact Workflow Implementation**

This system follows your exact requirements:

### **Step 1: Submit Target, Scope, etc.**
- **Program submission** with name, target domain, scope, reward range, platform
- **Scope definition** with multiple domains/subdomains
- **Platform selection** (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, Custom)
- **Reward range** specification for optimization

### **Step 2: Gemini Intelligence Sets Boundaries**
- **AI-powered analysis** of the bug bounty program
- **Attack surface identification** and priority scoring
- **Workflow strategy** determination based on target analysis
- **Boundary setting** (in-scope vs out-of-scope)
- **Success probability** assessment
- **Risk assessment** and timeline estimation

### **Step 3: Start Best Workflow**
- **Automated workflow execution** based on Gemini analysis
- **Reconnaissance phase** with subdomain enumeration, port scanning
- **Vulnerability scanning** with multiple tools (nuclei, nmap, etc.)
- **Manual testing** simulation for complex vulnerabilities
- **Exploitation phase** with proof-of-concept generation

### **Step 4: Find Vulnerabilities**
- **Automated vulnerability discovery** across all phases
- **XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypasses**
- **Business logic flaws** and race conditions
- **Novel attack vectors** and zero-day candidates
- **Severity assessment** and CVSS scoring

### **Step 5: Get Logs & Reproduction Steps**
- **Detailed vulnerability logs** with timestamps
- **Step-by-step reproduction** instructions
- **Technical details** and attack vectors
- **Expected results** and impact assessment
- **Timeline tracking** of discovery process

### **Step 6: Get POC**
- **Professional proof-of-concept** generation
- **Working exploit code** with explanations
- **Reproduction steps** for verification
- **Safety notes** and precautions
- **Ready for submission** format

### **Step 7: Explain Everything**
- **Comprehensive explanation** of all findings
- **Executive summary** with business impact
- **Methodology explanation** and approach
- **Vulnerability breakdown** with details
- **Recommendations** and next steps

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Complete Automation Flow**
```
🎯 Submit Program → 🤖 Gemini Analysis → ⚙️ Execute Workflow → 🔍 Find Vulns → 📝 Generate Logs → 💻 Create POC → 📊 Explain Everything
```

### **Step-by-Step Process**

#### **Step 1: Program Submission**
```python
# Submit bug bounty program
program_id = hunter.submit_program(
    name="HackerOne Program",
    target_domain="example.com",
    scope=["*.example.com", "api.example.com"],
    reward_range="$100-$1000",
    platform="hackerone"
)
```

#### **Step 2: Gemini Intelligence Analysis**
```python
# AI-powered analysis and boundary setting
analysis = hunter.analyze_with_gemini(program_id)
# Returns: attack surface, priority targets, workflow strategy, boundaries
```

#### **Step 3: Workflow Execution**
```python
# Execute optimal workflow determined by Gemini
workflow_results = hunter.execute_workflow(program_id)
# Returns: reconnaissance, scanning, manual testing, exploitation results
```

#### **Step 4: Vulnerability Discovery**
```python
# Find vulnerabilities based on workflow results
vulnerabilities = hunter.discover_vulnerabilities(program_id, workflow_results)
# Returns: list of discovered vulnerabilities with details
```

#### **Step 5: Logs & Reproduction**
```python
# Generate detailed logs and reproduction steps
logs = hunter.generate_logs_and_reproduction(program_id, vulnerability_ids)
# Returns: detailed logs and step-by-step reproduction instructions
```

#### **Step 6: POC Generation**
```python
# Generate professional proof-of-concepts
pocs = hunter.generate_pocs(program_id, vulnerability_ids)
# Returns: working exploit code and reproduction steps
```

#### **Step 7: Comprehensive Explanation**
```python
# Explain everything comprehensively
explanation = hunter.explain_everything(program_id)
# Returns: detailed explanation of all findings and methodology
```
