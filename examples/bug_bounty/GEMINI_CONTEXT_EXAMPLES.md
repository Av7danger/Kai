# ðŸŽ¯ GEMINI CONTEXT USAGE EXAMPLES

## EXAMPLE 1: Quick Target Testing
```bash
# Generate context for a specific target
python3 generate_context.py testphp.vulnweb.com --print

# This creates a complete prompt that you copy/paste to Gemini
# Gemini will then autonomously start testing the target
```

## EXAMPLE 2: With Program Scope
```bash
# First set up program scope
python3 scope_wizard.py quick example.com

# Then generate context with program info
python3 generate_context.py example.com scope_example_com.json

# This creates a targeted prompt with specific scope and payout info
```

## EXAMPLE 3: Complete Workflow
```bash
# 1. Set up detailed program scope
python3 scope_wizard.py
# (Follow interactive prompts)

# 2. Generate Gemini context
python3 generate_context.py target.com scope_myprogram.json

# 3. Copy the generated file content and paste into Gemini
# 4. Gemini starts autonomous bug bounty hunting!
```
